Summary:
1. Static attributes are created at class level.
2. Static attributes are accessed using ClassName.
3. Static attributes are object independent. We can access them without 
4. creating instance (object) of the class in which they are defined.
5. The value stored in static attribute is shared between all instances(objects) of the class in which the static attribute is defined.
Inheritance	----->	Mobile is a Product

Aggregation	----->        Customer has an Address. Even if the Customer is no more, there may be other customers in that address. So Address continues to exist even after a customer is no more

Composition	------->     College has a department. If the college closes, the department is also closed
